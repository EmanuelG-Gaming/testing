# Testing
Something that is my first attempt at modding (making a mod on) Minetest.

# Content
The content of "testing" is generally sparse, and there are still some things that are unfinished.

However, there are two tiers of "sifters" that can be used to sieve different materials. They work if a mesh is supplied, of course.
These meshes, along with the sifter base, determine the overall durability of the block.

What you can find though sieving includes flint in gravel, and stone grit in sand.
Stone grit is used to make stone.

More content to come soon.
